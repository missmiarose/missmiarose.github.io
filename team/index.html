    <div class="accordion-content open">
      <div class="bio">
        <p>    Mia Rose went from nothing to becoming a trailblazer, pioneer, and record-breaker.
It's a story that begins in the gutter and culminates with Rose becoming associated
with names like Howard Stern, James Gunn, and even Stan Lee. As a child, she faced
a seemingly insurmountable challenge, but amazingly transformed that into a
career filled with awards, surging popularity, and even a highlight in the publication
People Australia.<br>
Active nearly 20 years in the adult entertainment sphere, Mia kicked things off with
XRCO's Cream Dream of the Year award, then went on to star in 140 standalone
titles and enjoy further acclaim with multiple AVN nominations. She remains one of
the best-known starlets of the era, and one who enjoys a fiercely loyal fanbase.<br>
  But her successes don't stop with adult entertainment: Mia also rose to
prominence as a gaming personality. She made history by becoming the first female
streamer on Twitch, where she ultimately amassed a whopping 90,000 followers.
She was even awarded an NPC in the mega computer game hit, World of Warcraft,
which launched her even further into the gaming stratosphere.<br>
  Lastly, she discovered and cultivated her love for man's best friend, even acting as
a trainer of seeing-eye dogs for several years. And that led to her discovery of a
real-life hero in the animal kingdom: the she-wolf that reigned above male wolves
for years in Yellowstone, as detailed in a recent documentary. Mia is determined to
capture that strength and bravery in her most important project to date, \"Alpha 6,\"
a new adult film that will reinforce the fact that females can do anything.</p>
